Lab 1 - Create new project (Demo4)
  Create Lab1 -> to show final / effectively final
  Create a functional interface as  
   interface Convert {
	  int converttoRs(int dl);
  }
  Write main method to test
    declare a variable for conversionrate outside lambda
    use this variable in lambda
    try to change the value of the variable in side lambda and outside
    observe errors for final / effectively final
 modify converttoRs method to accept one more parameter like conrate and pass it as an argument
