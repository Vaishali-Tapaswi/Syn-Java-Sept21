Lab1 - in demo7
  Write code to create stream, check multiple access to same stream
  Stream<String> strstream = Stream.of("Anita","Vaishali","Sonali", "Simran","Vishal","Aman","Shree","Dyna");
		strstream.forEach(System.out::println);
		System.out.println("----------------");
	  strstream.forEach(System.out::println);
   Line number 6 will give error, observe that error and then modify code to 
    declare list 
      List<String> names=Arrays.asList("Anita","Vaishali","Sonali", "Simran","Vishal","Aman","Shree","Dyna");
		and get stream from list
      names.stream().foreach
    invoke multiple times
